            <span class="rules-heading">Swiss Standard Conquest:</span>

            <p>Players will compete in a standard Swiss Tournament, where they will compete over the internet to determine the ‘Round of Eight’ over 5 rounds of Swiss (i.e., the eight finishers based on match scores from the Swiss `Tournament)</p>
            
            <p>All matches inside a round must be completed at which point all new pairings for the upcoming round will be made based on the results of the previous round. 
            These pairings will be based on the Swiss record of the players through the tournament. Starting with the players with the best record, 
            players are randomly paired against other players with the same record that they have not played previously in the tournament. If there are no players left with the same record, 
            the remaining player will be paired against a random player with the next best record. This process continues until there are no matches able to be created.
             Any remaining player receives a bye. Ties will be determined by a set of tie breakers determined by the organizer. 5 Rounds will advance this way at which point the 
            Round of 8 will be determined by the 8 players with the best Swiss Match Record. Any players with the same match record will be ranked according to their tie breakers. 
            Once in the Round of 8 the next Stage will begin which will be a single elimination 8 player bracket. Players will be seeded into this bracket based off their match scores 
            from the Swiss Tournament Round.</p>

            <span class="rules-heading">Conquest: </span>
           
             <p>When a player wins a game, the winning player cannot use the class that was used for that game for the remainder of the match. The player that loses a game can keep the same class or switch to a different class at his/her choice, with such a switch being a “blind” as to his/her opponent’s chosen class. The first player to win four games wins the match.</p>

            <span class="rules-heading">Buckeye Brawl Specific / Game Forfeitures: </span>

            <p>For all matches, each player will use Hearthstone card decks that he/she has created (using cards he/she has collected) on the Americas region servers on Battle.net. Card decks created on other regions’ servers are not eligible for play in Tour matches, unless a different ruling is decided by the Blizzard Esports team.</p>

            <p>After the first game in a match begins, if a player leaves the match lobby, or cancels the “game challenge,” or leaves the Hearthstone game client for any reason, it is considered a match forfeiture and the opposing player will win the match.</p>

            <p>Similarly, once the starting hands are provided by the Hearthstone game client, if a player leaves the game for any reason, the player is considered to have forfeited the game. If a player selects a deck with a class that he or she used to win a previous game in the match, that game is considered a loss and forfeited</p>
